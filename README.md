2. Go Farther to the right side to get heavier and stronger fishes that require better gear.
3. Zoom out/in camera
4. Move up/down camera
5. Other frog colors buyable with points
6. Timer that goes down (get fishes as fast as you can) calculate a formula for catched fishes
7. Pressing alternating keys "x" and "z/y" to catch fish
8. avoid path of some fishes in a certain depth to go deeper to get better fish
9. on bottom of ocean parts hide some treasures for upgrades (like fishing rod or boat stuff)
10. Make it more like a mobile game where u go deeper with more points etc.
11. 10 Levels with getting fish quick in certain time (bonus time if you get a good fish, bonus chest with bonus time (hour glass))
12. In the start of the game you can change the color palette of the game (with arrow keys like on the gameboy)
13. one of the levels is in the bermuda islands (spoopy fish)
